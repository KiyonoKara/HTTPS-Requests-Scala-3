## Overview
This repository holds a Scala 3 version of [HTTPS-Requests-Scala](https://github.com/KaNguy/HTTPS-Requests-Scala). This version is much more compact and light-weight, and does not have a large amount of files.    
> An object-oriented approach to helping create HTTP/HTTPS requests, and a partial implementation & wrapper of Java's networking package with great help from Scala's Source library. This library simplifies the making of HTTP/HTTPS requests and wraps a number of Java's `HttpURLConnection` class in Scala. There are many features and checks being added to make the most optimal HTTP/HTTPS requests in Scala.
